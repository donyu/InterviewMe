[root]/lib = library files that are loaded first
[root]/client = put client-side javascript here so we don't need Meteor.is_client
[root]/server = put server-side javascript here so we don't need Meteor.is_server
[root]/public = serve static media from here such as image.jpg (also you can refer to it directly as image.jpg)
[root]/.meteor = keep special project related info in here such as modules installed
